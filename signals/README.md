## The Observer Pattern

Observer is a **behavioral design pattern** that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing. The patten is also called *Publish-Subscribe*.

The observer can be a class, an object or a function that stores its subscribers and contains a `subscribe` and an `update` method.
